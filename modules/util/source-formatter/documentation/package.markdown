# Java package formatting

## Naming

The java package name should match the directory structure of the location of the java file.

Example:

The package of class UserLocalServiceImpl located in `portal-impl\com\liferay\portal\service\impl\` is

```java
package com.liferay.portal.service.impl;
```
